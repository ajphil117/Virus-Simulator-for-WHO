# Disease/Virus/Infection Simulator for the World Health Organisation

The team was given 4 weeks to develop a large-scale simulation program in MatLab to visualise and analyse the effects of potential disease, virus, and infection outbreaks across the world.
This simulation was created for the World Health Organisation to see the potential effects and implement actions to reduce the risks of possible outbreaks.
For this project, I created code to analyse the final data, created automated graphics based on this data, and tested/edited all sections of the final live script product.

This project taught me the basics of data analysis using programming.

## Demo Video
A demo video of the simulation in action can be found in the [project files](/Virus%20Simulation%20Demo.mp4).

## Project Goal and Expansion
The main project goal was to create a simulation program that can simulate the effects of potential disease, virus, and infection outbreaks and analyse the results of an outbreak.
The team expanded this goal by creating a flexible enough program that could model any disease in any part of the globe.  

We combined our knowledge of Cellular Automata and Image Processing and created a game of life simulation that was based on a population density heat map of a particular country.
For this single software to be used for every country or city we created the code to work with any screen-shot of the population density heat map from [this website](http://luminocity3d.org/WorldPopDen/#3/12.00/10.00 )_*_.

This allowed us to run our simulation and measure the spread of disease in any country we wanted, as every country in this map holds the same legend and population density levels.
Including this feature was essential as it allowed us to create a simulation that can compare the spread of disease in different countries, geographical locations, cities, and any different point on the world map desired; hence making our simulation more applicable to the real world and more appealing to the WHO.

_* Note that the images from the website had to be edited slightly to work well with the simulation. Smaller images were required for the simulation to run in the live script rather than a normal script. We provided a series of images to use for the simulation in the download folder._
